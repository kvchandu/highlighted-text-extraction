# highlighted-text-extraction
 Extracted highlighted text from pictures. OpenCV and Python

# Project Goal:
Given a picture of a page from a book that has some highlighted text (ideally uploaded to a web application hosted on a website) return the text that is highlighted. Can be linked to note taking apps to automatically store all the highlighted text, or simply return the string, or can be extended to anything else. 

# Project Plan
1) Get a page, and reproject it to a full picture? (Find out if necessary)
2) Find highlighted text on the page. Should be able to properly differentiate between highlighted and non highlighted text. 
3) Run OCR on the text, and get the text.
4) Forward the text to an API, or just simply print on page. 

# Project Learnings. 

1) OpenCV functions : Although this project is not ML based project, OpenCV is a vital library needed to have in our toolkit. 
2) Web hosting : To create this as a website application need to learn the ins and outs of hosting python applications on the website. Will be a challenging task, but will help me in hosting future projects more effectively. 
3) Working demo : Having a working demo on the website is a fun thing to have.
